# p-value
Lecture notes for ``What's a p-value?: On Social Science and Statistics''

[These notes](https://github.com/zdelrosario/p-value/blob/master/handout.pdf) support a talk I gave at the Stanford ASEE student chapter on the *reproducibility crisis* in social science. This topic is important for engineering educators, as education research is built on a foundation of solid social science. Without confidence in such results, it is difficult to make confident evidence-based teaching decisions.

In these notes, I introduce the *p-value*, a statistical summary of experimental data used in social science. This tool is used by researchers to study data, but also by journal editors and reviewers to choose what work is appropriate for publication. The complex interaction of binary decisions, incentive structures, and inherent randomness contribute to the *replication crisis* in social science---the failure to observe repeatable behavior in human experiments.

My aim with these notes is to provide *just enough* detail for engineers to be informed when reading social science literature. These notes are a starting point: In them I refer to suggested further reading, and make recommendations for how to think about published work on engineering education.
